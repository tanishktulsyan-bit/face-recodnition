# face-recodnition

📋 Overview

The Face Recognition System is a Java-based desktop application that uses computer vision techniques to detect and recognize human faces in real-time using a webcam or from stored images. The system leverages OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) for face detection and recognition and integrates seamlessly with Java through the OpenCV Java bindings.

This project can be used for authentication systems, attendance tracking, or security access control.
